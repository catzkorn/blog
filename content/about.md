# About Me

&nbsp;Hi, I'm Charlotte! Originally from from the UK, but now living in beautiful British Columbia, Canada, in the town of Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish).

I'm a critical illness survivor and PhD drop-out turned Software Engineer. My background is in Environmental Science with an interest in natural resource extraction.

I'm happiest in the mountains, addicted to trail running and have too ~~many~~ few cats. Passionate about the environment, mental health and standing desks. Read occasionally, watch movies often and dance to 80s music always.
