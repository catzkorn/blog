# Personal Profile

Meticulous, user-focused software engineer with a strong track record of delivering high-quality features that address real user needs. Leverage a non-technical background to bring a unique, empathetic lens to product development. Proactively identify cross-functional issues and lead initiatives that improve both customer experience and internal workflows.

# Experience

## Edera (November 2024 - Present)

### _Senior Software Engineer_

_Go, Rust, Typescript, React, Prometheus, among others_

Joined as an early engineer focusing on product user experience, from the CLI to observability and documentation, while improving backend processes and tooling.

- Designed and delivered the Edera Demo Portal, a website which dynamically deploys the Edera Protect product in the cloud, allowing users to test the product via a browser-embedded SSH session, securely proxied via a websocket. This was created for Kubecon EU as an engineering driven effort to gain business leads.

- Redesigned and reimplemented the Edera Orchestrator from Rust to Go, increasing documentation, testing and functionality standards of the service.

- Developed a framework for future observability standards and implemented the first phase in the Edera Orchestrator, following industry best practices.

- Rewrote the existing Rust-specific Protobuf generation script into a generation-language agnostic, flexible and extensible framework, including linting, formatting and generation. Implemented industry best practice CI jobs to ensure consistent generation from Protobuf files.

- Refactored legacy code for the Edera Kubernetes SPDY proxy to improve readability, adding tests and remediating issues found. Added support for the Kubernetes v5 Port-Forward protocol, utilizing SPDY and gRPC bidirectional streaming.

- Added auto-completion and made various user experience improvements to the Edera Protect CLI.

- Relaunched the [Edera documentation](https://docs.edera.dev/) site, added CLI and Metrics docs, as well as lead generating call to actions.

- Created developer docs for setting up the Edera development environment, both locally and cloud-based, reducing friction for engineers.

- Spearheaded multiple internal initiatives surrounding customer experience, developer experience, development process and other areas.
