# Interests

My personal interests include outdoor sports such as trail running, mountaineering, skiing and mountain biking. I am currently training to run a trail ultra marathon. I enjoy reading fiction and non-fiction books, watching movies, playing board games, listening to music of all genres, and I have been a lifelong fan of motorsport. I continue to have a personal interest in global environmental issues and actively keep up-to-date on the latest science.
