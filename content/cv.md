# Personal Profile

I am a passionate and driven backend developer with an interest in dev-ops and security. In the past four years, I have survived a life threatening illness, left a PhD, gone on a journey of self discovery, and found the thing that drives me: software engineering. Learning to code has reawakened a lifelong passion for technology, learning and innovation I thought I had lost. My bootcamp experience has provided me with a foundation, and now I am searching for a role to grow as a developer. Leaning on the skills I acquired during my research, such as project and time management, allows me to be a valuable contributor to my team. I know what I want in the next four years, and I want to become a _damn good_ software engineer.

# Interests

My personal interests include outdoor sports such as trail running, mountaineering, skiing and climbing. I enjoy reading fiction and non-fiction books, watching movies, playing computer games, listening to music of all genres, and I have been a lifelong fan of motorsport. I continue to have a personal interest in global environmental issues and actively keep up-to-date on the latest science. I run a blog about my journey as a new developer.
